Welcome to my first webpage.

I am currently learning how to become a full stack developer.

This project is easing me into using the basics of HTML5 and CSS3, working in the Cloud9_IDE environment and backing up my projects to GitHub.

Also introducing me to the idea of versioning code and providing me with the ability to rollback code if required.

I am getting to grips with the following technologies and am using them in this project:

HTML5, CSS3, Cloud9_IDE, Git and GitHub
